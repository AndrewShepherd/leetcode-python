## Curated List

The are three categories of difficulty in Leetcode. This list attempts to show questions in order of difficulty.
(Some of these questions a trivial one-liners in Python but require significant knowledge in lower-level languages)

### Math Problems

- [Ugly Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/ugly-number/): Simple example of integer division and modulus
- [Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-steps-to-reduce-a-number-to-zero/): Like the project Euler question 3 - just a while loop
- [Count of Operations To Obtain Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-operations-to-obtain-zero/): Similar to GCD problem

### Array Processing

Just going by the [array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/) tag

- [Concatenation of Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/concatenation-of-array/): A simple one liner
- [Sum of 1d Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array): Creating a new array as an accumulation of an existing array
- [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii):m Not really a dynamic programming problem. You are simply adding all of the positive differences
- [Shuffle the Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/shuffle-the-array/): Interpolate two arrays
- [Kids with the Greatest Number of Candies](https://leetcode.com/problems/kids-with-the-greatest-number-of-candies/): Simple once you understand the problem. Involves the `max` function and converting a list into a list of bools
- [Decompress Run-Length Encoded List](https://leetcode.com/problems/decompress-run-length-encoded-list/): Understanding the problem is hard until you read the example.
- [Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/): In-placed rearranging of the elements in an array
- [Move Zeros](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/): In-place rearranging of the elements in an array

### Dictionaries / Hash Tables

- [Word Pattern](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-pattern/): Maintaining and looking up two hash tables

### Binary Search

- [First Bad Version](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/): Probably the easiest binary search problem you can have

### Use of Classes

- [Range Sum Query - Immutable](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-immutable/): Setting a value in the `__init__` method, then querying it in a different method
